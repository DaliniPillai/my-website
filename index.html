               <h2>Reasons to Adopt a Pet</h2>
               <p>Wondering whether to adopt or buy a dog or cat?</p><br/>

    <p>Adopt don't buy

    There are lots of good reasons to adopt rather than buy a pet. Here are a few of them:

    Buying a pet can easily cost $500 to $1,000 or more. Adoption costs range from $50 to $200, depending on whether the pet comes from the city shelter or a rescue group that has spent money on boarding, vets and grooming.
    You’re getting more for your money if you get a mixed breed. Based on the well-established principle of “hybrid vigor,” a mixed-breed animal is likely to live longer and cost less in vet bills than a pure breed. Many purebred dogs are prone to developing health problems ranging from breathing difficulties to hip dysplasia to an enlarged heart.</p>
